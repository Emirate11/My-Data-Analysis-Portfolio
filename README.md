# My-Data-Analysis-Portfolio
Iâ€™m an expert at taking a stack of messy spreadsheets and turning them into a cohesive, coherent data set for data visualization and analysis. I also merge data outputs from databases and spatial information.
I am skilled at problem solving, communication and data analysis. I have experience communicating statistical concepts to those with any quantitative skill level. I make it a priority to listen to and fully understand the goals of my client prior to beginning any analysis or consulting project. In my experience, projects built on a professional, respectful relationship of understanding and clear communication are successful and rewarding for both the client and statistician.

My statistical analysis skills include:
Data Cleaning 
Preparation
Exploratory Data Analysis
Data Visualization
Business Intelligence
Tableau
SQL

This repository contains my Data Analytics portfolio projects ranging from Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau.
